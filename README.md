# Dancing-digital-twin
Expanding the digital twin that ISB research group at Link√∂ping University develop. Expanding with biomechanical modelling of the human body by a dance sequence. Later acquired muscle forces will be analysed.

The pipeline is developed in OpenSim. It includes two OSIM-files with the model in OpenSim with marker set for both motion capture labs Vicon and OptiTrack. It also includes setup XML-files for scaling and inverse kinematics which contains all the information needed in order to run the tools in OpenSim. A motion capture file wich is converted to a TRC-file with Mokka is also included but only for the marker set for OptiTrack.
